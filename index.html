    <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I am always learning new things. Now, I'm learning how to build webpages.<br />
               In addition, I'm a “Motivated Self-Starter” with a “Whatever it takes” “Never give up” attitude, with a wide variety of experiences to be inspired by, to become a valued asset to your engineering team. Willing to dedicate the time needed to achieve the process and production lines operating at their full potential.
